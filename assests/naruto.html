    <big><h3>Starting of Naruto shippuden: <br></h3>
    It has been two and a half years since Naruto Uzumaki left Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf Village, <br>
     for intense training following events which fueled his desire to be stronger. Now Akatsuki, <br>
      the mysterious organization of elite rogue ninja, is closing in on their grand plan <br>
       which may threaten the safety of the entire shinobi world.
       <br> <br>

    Although Naruto is older and sinister events loom on the horizon, he has changed <br>
    little in personality—still rambunctious and childish—though he is now far more confident <br>
     and possesses an even greater determination to protect his friends and home. Come <br> 
      whatever may, Naruto will carry on with the fight for what is important to him, <br>
       even at the expense of his own body, in the continuation of the saga about the <br>
        boy who wishes to become Hokage.</big>  <br>
