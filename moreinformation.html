<br><br>
<h2>Tanjiro Kamado:
</h2>
<big>
    <h3>Appearance:</h3>
Tanjiro is a muscular young man with rather tanned skin and an athletic physique.
He has ruffled, black hair with burgundy tips, combed back to expose his forehead,
and wide, dark red eyes with white pupils that appear lighter around the lower section 
of his irises. He also has a scar on the top left of his forehead, which he received
when he protected his younger brother from a falling brazier.[5] The scar originally
looked somewhat like a graze until his fight with the Hand Demon during the Final
 Selection, after which it develops into his Demon Slayer Mark. It is noted that his
hands are visibly rougher for someone his age, as a result of his rigorous training
under Sakonji Urokodaki. Tanjiro looks remarkably similar in appearance to his 
ancestor Sumiyoshi, possessing the same facial structure, eyes, and hairstyle as him,
although Sumiyoshi's hair was longer, about shoulder-length and would be tied in a 
ponytail behind his head.

Tanjiro first appears wearing a checkered, black-and-sea-foam-green haori over a white
robe and black pants. He occasionally sports a turquoise scarf and is seen with circular,
white bands looped around his calves. He also wears a distinct pair of hanafuda earrings,
with the image of a white-and-red flower. His hair is also kept tied back in small #
ponytail or bun; as he trains with Sabito and Makomo, his hair grows to his shoulders.

During the Final Selection, Tanjiro wears a blue, cloud-patterned jinbei-styled kimono and
black pants, nearly identical to Sakonji's outfit. He still wears his hanafuda earrings,
but his hair is cut extremely short and remains the same length since. Similar to the
rest of the apprentices that were trained under Sakonji, Tanjiro wears a hand-carved
fox mask crafted from his master on the left side of his head. The mask has red 
accents on the eyes, ears, and spots on each corner of its mouth. On the upper right
corner of the mask, there is a sun-shaped design that likely symbolizes the scar on his forehead.

After becoming a Demon Slayer, Tanjiro wears the standard Demon Slayer uniform, a dark-brown
gakuran jacket, a white belt, baggy pants that extend into tabi socks, a pair of zōri
with red straps, and bands of white cloth wrapped tightly around his calves, 
all beneath his signature checkered haori. He carries a large wooden box on 
his back (which was a gift to him from Sakonji Urokodaki), where his sister 
sleeps as they travel during the day.

During his second encounter with Muzan Kibutsuji, he injures his right eye in the
Infinity Castle. As the battle progresses, Tanjiro suddenly collapses and his wound
begins to form a large mass over his right eye due to the poison inflicted on him by Muzan.
Later on, when Tanjiro wakes up, he is described as looking 'repulsive' by Muzan. Later
in the battle Tanjiro's left arm is severed by Muzan.

After being turned into a Demon by Muzan, Tanjiro is able to heal the growth on his face as well as
regenerate his lost arm and other smaller injuries. He obtains eyes with slit pupils, fangs and
flame-shaped marks over his left forehead and right jaw that are reminiscent of those of Kokushibo,
in addition to a third, smaller flame-shaped mark coming down from the right side of his head
down to his eyebrow after he conquered the weakness to sunlight. His scar turns into a
flame-pattern as if it were a permanent Demon Slayer Mark, has become longer and is the largest
of the three, and all three marks vaguely point towards his nose, though only his scar-mark
reaches it. He still dons his bloodstained corps uniform, one sleeve ripped off where his 
arm was severed, but loses his checkered haori and the Nichirin Blade at his hip.

After returning to his human form, Tanjiro loses the ability to see from his right eye,
the iris of which is now a dull pink-gray color and the pupil black rather than its 
original white. His left arm, which he regrew as a Demon, now takes the appearance of that
which an older person may have, becoming wrinkled and skeletal, and he loses all feeling in
it below the elbow and thus the ability to move it from his shoulder demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-team_a21ubm2UmZqaraWkpJRobWllrWdma2U

<big><h3>Personality</h3>
Tanjiro is kind by nature and has been described by others as having very gentle eyes.
He exhibits a great deal of determination and will not give up once he has a goal to
achieve; the best example of this being his relentless quest to find a cure for Nezuko.
Even though he is relatively strong on his own, Tanjiro isn't opposed to asking others
for help when he needs it. He is very protective of his friends and even more so of his
younger sister. However, despite his kind and understanding nature, Tanjiro does have
a limit to his tolerance and has a distaste for rudeness and cowardice as he easily
becomes annoyed by Zenitsu Agatsuma's constant whining, and angered by Inosuke
Hashibira's barbaric actions.
    
Tanjiro's most notable attribute is his ability to empathize with anyone, even Demons,
which often makes him hesitate before delivering the final blow. This moment of hesitation
has a downside, as it has allowed some Demons to take advantage of Tanjiro's understanding
nature to recover and continue the fight on rare occasions. However, as Tanjiro gains experience
over the years of his service, he becomes more calculating and strict in his decisions.
His courage to protect the weak commits him to face his enemy with respect and dignity, 
whether versus good people or evil Demons.
    
Under Tanjiro's rather kind and friendly shell, is a person with a growing fire of rage and 
vengeance inside of them. This side of him leaks out when Tanjiro first confronts Muzan, 
ready to take out his sword and attack him. When Muzan escapes, Tanjiro releases his frustration
and declares he will be the one to kill Muzan. In another event, when the Demon Slayers have their
necks snapped by the Mother Spider Demon's threads, Tanjiro shows noticeable anger that even 
Inosuke senses. This side of Tanjiro fully comes out after Muzan's speech where he compares himself
-to a natural disaster. Tanjiro responds to that by calling Muzan "a being that should not exist."
    
As a Demon, Tanjiro appeared to be mindless, like most initially are following their transformation.
He acted like a feral beast, attacking anyone in sight without any hesitation. Not even his friends
and comrades were safe. The one exception was Nezuko, who he refused to harm even after tasting her
blood; a possible sign that he was fighting his transformation. His hostility towards the Demon Slayers
might also have been due to his mind being affected by Muzan's desire to kill all Demon Slayers.
    
<h3>Abilities</h3>
Overall Abilities: From the start, although not a part of the Demon Slayer Corps, Tanjiro was able
to catch Giyu Tomioka, the Water Hashira off guard. After starting his training in the Water Breathing,
he has become strong enough to take on multiple demons including a former Lower Rank 6, Kyogai.
After recalling the Hinokami Kagura, he learned from his father as a child, he would've defeated Rui,
Lower Rank 5, if Rui hadn't cut off his own head prior. After awakening his Demon Slayer Mark
and training even further, Tanjiro has proven to be able to hold his own against even the Upper
Rank like Akaza, with Giyu even comparing his strength to that of a Hashira. After getting
poisoned by Muzan and having a mysterious vision of his ancestors, Tanjiro was able to fight
against Muzan by himself, who had just single-handedly defeated all five remaining Hashira
along with Zenitsu and Inosuke. Muzan expressed feelings of unease towards Tanjiro due to 
the similarities between him and Yoriichi.
    
<h3>Physical Abilities:</h3>
Enhanced Strength: After his training at Sagiri Mountain, Tanjiro has gained enhanced strength 
and speed and has demonstrated a great use of it, as seen when he jumped twice his height over 
the Hand Demon, who killed Sakonji's disciples, during Final Selection. His forehead is noted to 
be unusually sturdy as well since he's able with it to injure Sanemi Shinazugawa, the Wind Hashira
and even momentarily stun Gyutaro, Upper Rank 6.
    
Immense Speed & Reflexes: Tanjiro can keep up with Akaza, Upper Rank 3 and an incredibly fast Demon,
who can move faster than the eye can see, during their second encounter. After awakening his
Demon Slayer Mark, Tanjiro's speed increases even further to the point that even Akaza couldn't
react in time and process his movements. After awakening his Demon Slayer Mark, Tanjiro gains
extremely sharp reflexes, dodging and reacting to attacks from both Akaza and the Demon King,
Muzan Kibutsuji. This has also been displayed when he got extremely incensed, when he becomes
capable of easily dodging and countering Daki's attacks while she is in her weaker form,
without Daki being able to injure him at all.
    
Immense Stamina & Endurance: Tanjiro has amazing stamina and endurance. In the Sunrise Countdown
Arc, he lasted one of the longest, almost an hour exerting himself to the physical and mental limit,
while still being able to tolerate and suppress all the damage and injuries he sustained from
Muzan Kibutsuji's blood attacks and his powerful physical blows.
    
<h3>Mental Abilities</h3>
Genius Intellect: Even before encountering a member of the Twelve Kizuki, Tanjiro has displayed
the ability to be incredibly sagacious and analytical while fighting Demons, being able to
discern their abilities and find the proper countermeasures. One example is during the fight
against Akaza, he was able to decipher and deduce his mysterious ability to sense his opponent's
locations and was even able to search his memories for a proper countermeasure. However, this
ability is not limited to fighting, as he can find a way to mitigate his own weaknesses like
in the fight with Kyogai, when his ribs were injured and Gyutaro, when he was extremely worn
out fighting Daki.
    
Tactical Intellect: Tanjiro possesses incredible and innate thinking capacity and wits. He has mainly displayed this through combat where he is able to conceive multiple battle strategies, discern the abilities and powers of his opponent's and find weaknesses in them all while engaging in tough combat.
